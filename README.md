<b>Summary</b>:
The present project of degree on the study and implementation of an autonomous navigation algorithm for a scale electric vehicle, is made in the context of junior researcher of the Center for Research in Sciences, Technology and Advanced Innovation of the Catholic University "Nuestra Señora de la Asunción" Campus Alto Paraná. This project was carried out in order to train the knowledge regarding autonomous navigation, which is currently in the growth phase of the global automotive sector.
This research includes studies on autonomous navigation, concepts, classifications and the different algorithms that compose it, as well as simulations in a simulation platform selected to analyze the operation of the chosen algorithm and the implementation of the same in the electric vehicle at scale thanks to a selected embedded system.
For the fulfillment of the proposed objectives, the concept of code reuse was used and it was customized to work on the "Aguara'i" physical platform. In this way, it was possible to conclude that the performance of the selected algorithm, pure pursuit navigation algorithm, was very effective and satisfactory. The implementation was developed in a short period of time and the routes traveled during the autonomous navigation were similar to the established waypoints, that is, it was possible to establish values, of the lookahead distance, so that the errors do not exceed the set limits. </br>

<b>Keywords:</b> Autonomous navigation. Navigation algorithms. Pure pursuit. Lookahead distance.</br>
